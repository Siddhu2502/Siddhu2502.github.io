The observations are made easy for the agent to understand. For observation the agents is given the following information (current position and the speed to move is determined by the following inputs)\n\nangle_to_up : angle between the drone and the up vector (to observe gravity)\nvelocity : velocity of the drone\nangle_velocity : angle of the velocity vector\ndistance_to_target : distance to the target\nangle_to_target : angle between the drone and the target\nangle_target_and_velocity : angle between the to_target vector and the velocity vector\ndistance_to_target : distance to the target\n\nBefore going deeper into this we must know some basic concepts of Reinforcement Learning\n\nIntroduction\nReinforcement learning is an area of Machine Learning. It is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation. Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in a way that in supervised learning the training data has the answer key with it so the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the given task. In the absence of a training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience.\nReinforcement Learning (RL) is the science of decision making. It is about learning the optimal behavior in an environment to obtain maximum reward. In RL, the data is accumulated from machine learning systems that use a trial-and-error method. Data is not part of the input that we would find in supervised or unsupervised machine learning.\nWe have 4 main components when it comes to reinforcement learning.\n\nReward\n\nThe rewards are scalar quantity which is a single number which can range from [−N,N] and sometimes it can have multiple outcomes so choosing them is the job of the agent\nThe reward should be outside the control of the agent which means that the reward should come from the environment in which the agent is training this will make sure that the agent wont be able to simply add more reward\nThe reward depends on the domain\nHaving singular scalar value is good as its easy to estimate the model performance\nReward should be bounded that is from -N to N\nRewards must be given for each epoch or every single iteration\n\n\n\nPolicy\nA policy is a rule that determines how an agent chooses an action in each state. It can be deterministic or stochastic, depending on whether the agent always selects the same action or randomly picks an action according to some probability distribution. Policy is a conditional probability which is given by \\(\\pi \\left(  a| s\\right) =P( A_{t}= a| s_{t}= s)\\) -&gt; The following equation stands for the probablity that the agent will take action ‘A’ given that at time t the state is ‘S’\n\n\nReturn\nReturn is a measure of the total reward that an agent can expect to receive in the future, starting from a given state or state-action pair. It is often used as a target for learning the value functions that estimate how good a state or an action is. There are different ways to define return, depending on how the rewards are discounted or summed up. One common way is to use the discounted return, which is given by the formula:\n\\[\nG_t = R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \\dots = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\gamma^k R_{t+k+1}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(G_t\\) is the return at time step \\(t\\), \\(R_{t+k+1}\\) is the reward received at time step \\(t+k+1\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) is a discount factor between 0 and 1 that determines how much the agent values the future rewards.\nAgent which uses only the first term is called as near-sighted agent.\n\n\n\nValue Function\nThe value function \\(V^\\pi(s)\\) is the expected value of the return \\(G_t\\) when the agent follows the policy \\(\\pi\\) and starts from the state \\(s\\).\n\\[\nV^\\pi(s) = \\mathbb{E}_\\pi \\left\\{ G_t \\mid S_t = s \\right\\}\n\\]\nThe expectation \\(\\mathbb{E}_\\pi\\) is taken over the distribution of the possible trajectories that the agent can experience under the policy \\(\\pi\\). The value function represents how good or desirable a state is for the agent, and it can be used to evaluate or improve the policy."

    "text": "Formulation\nIn our research, we make certain assumptions to simplify the calculations and make them more static. The primary assumption is given by the following equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& P(S_{t+1}=S^{\\prime}, R_{t+1}=v \\mid S_t=S, A_t=a) -&gt; {1} \\\\\n& P(S^{\\prime}, R \\mid S, a) -&gt; {2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nHere, \\(P(S^{\\prime}, R \\mid S, a)\\) represents the stationary assumption.\nTo obtain the output, we need:\n\n\\(S\\), which represents the set of states, also known as the state space.\n\\(A\\), which represents the set of actions.\n\\(\\gamma\\), which is used when we are considering discounted returns.\n\nInstead of using a single joint distribution given by the equation, we can break down the equation into two parts:\n\nTransition probabilities \\(P\\left(s^{\\prime} \\mid s, A\\right)\\)\nExpected reward \\(E\\left(r \\mid s, a, s^{\\prime}\\right)\\)\n\nWe write it down to break down the joint distribution. Here, only \\(E\\left(r \\mid s, a, s^{\\prime}\\right)\\) is enough as we are optimizing rewards.\nThe formulation of Markov Decision Process (MDP) is given by the Bellman equation:\n\\[\nS, A, P\\left(s^{\\prime} \\mid S, A\\right), E\\left(r \\mid s, a, S^{\\prime}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThe Bellman Equation\nThe Bellman equation is central to the theory of MDPs. It provides a recursive formulation for the value function of a policy in an MDP. The value function represents the expected return (accumulated rewards) for an agent starting in a particular state and following a specific policy thereafter.\nThe Bellman equation for MDPs can be expressed in two forms: one for the state-value function V(s) and another for the action-value function Q(s, a):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& V(s) = \\max_a \\left\\{R(s,a) + \\gamma \\sum P(s'|s,a) V(s')\\right\\}  -&gt; {3} \\\\\n& Q(s,a) = R(s,a) + \\gamma \\sum P(s'|s,a) \\max_{a'} Q(s',a')  -&gt; {4}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn these equations:\n\nV(s) is the value of state s under a policy.\nQ(s, a) is the value of taking action a in state s under a policy.\nR(s, a) is the immediate reward received after transitioning from state s with action a.\nP(s'|s, a) is the transition probability of landing in state s' when action a is taken in state s.\nγ is the discount factor which determines the present value of future rewards.\n\nThe Bellman equation essentially states that the value of a state (or state-action pair) is equal to the immediate reward plus the discounted expected value of the next state (or state-action pair). This recursive nature of the Bellman equation allows us to solve MDPs using dynamic programming methods."

    "text": "34. Explain the concept of cloud-native application development, highlighting its key principles and how it differs from traditional application development approaches.\nCloud-native application development is an approach that focuses on building applications specifically designed to run in cloud environments, leveraging the inherent characteristics and services offered by cloud platforms. It differs from traditional application development in several key ways:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Principles of Cloud-Native Application Development\n\n\n\n\nMicroservices Architecture\nContainerization\nDevOps and Continuous Delivery\nAutomated Scaling and Orchestration\nDeclarative Configuration\nResilience and Fault Tolerance\nObservability and Monitoring\n\n\n\n\nMicroservices Architecture: Cloud-native applications are typically built using a microservices architecture, where the application is decomposed into small, independent, and loosely coupled services. This architecture promotes scalability, resilience, and agility.\nContainerization: Cloud-native applications are packaged and deployed using containers, such as Docker. They provide a consistent and isolated runtime environment, enabling applications to run reliably across different environments.\nDevOps and Continuous Delivery:\n\n\nCloud-native development embraces DevOps principles, emphasizing collaboration between development and operations teams.\nContinuous integration, continuous delivery, and automated deployment pipelines are essential for rapidly delivering updates and new features.\n\n\nAutomated Scaling and Orchestration: Cloud-native applications are designed to automatically scale resources up or down based on demand. Orchestration tools like Kubernetes are used to manage and coordinate the deployment, scaling, and scheduling of containerized applications across cloud infrastructure.\nDeclarative Configuration: Cloud-native applications rely on declarative configuration files (e.g., YAML or JSON) to define the desired state of the application and its dependencies. This enables version control, reproducibility, and automated management of application deployments.\nResilience and Fault Tolerance: Cloud-native applications are built with resilience in mind, embracing concepts like self-healing, circuit breakers, and retries. They are designed to handle failures gracefully and recover quickly.\nObservability and Monitoring: Cloud-native applications leverage built-in observability and monitoring capabilities provided by cloud platforms, enabling comprehensive logging, tracing, and monitoring of distributed applications."

    "text": "Python’s Array Module\nThe array module in Python is used to store homogeneous data types such as integers, floats, etc. It is similar to lists in Python, but with the added advantage of being more efficient in terms of memory and performance for certain operations.\nWhen to use the array module? You should consider using the array module when you need to store a large amount of homogeneous data. This is because arrays are more memory efficient than lists. They also provide faster access in some cases because they store data in contiguous memory blocks, unlike lists.\nComparing array module with normal list Here are some key differences between the array module and a normal list in Python:\nHomogeneity: Arrays can only store elements of the same type, while lists can store elements of different types.\nMemory and Performance: Arrays are more memory efficient and can provide faster access and manipulation for large amounts of data.\nFunctionality: Lists come with a variety of built-in methods for manipulation like append, remove, pop, etc. Arrays have fewer methods but are more specialized for numerical and computational tasks.\nIn the provided code snippet, an array of type ‘h’ (short integers) is created to store prime numbers. This is a good use case for the array module because we are dealing with a large amount of homogeneous numerical data.\nIn this code, the array is more memory efficient than a list would be, and it provides fast and efficient access to the prime numbers stored within it.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "What is proxy ARP? Why is the term proxy used here?\nProxy ARP is:\n\nA technique where a device answers ARP requests on behalf of another.\nUsually implemented by routers to facilitate communication between subnets.\n“Proxy” refers to the router acting as an intermediary or representative.\nIt responds with its own MAC address for IP addresses it can route to.\nHelps in scenarios where devices can’t directly communicate due to network segmentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow up question\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does proxy ARP differ from traditional ARP?\n\nProxy ARP is used for routing between networks, while ARP is for local address resolution.\nProxy ARP responds with its own MAC address, while ARP responds with the target’s MAC address."

    "text": "Why do we need IP address when the MAC address is unique? Can’t we communicate only with MAC address?\nWe need IP addresses alongside MAC addresses because:\n\nMAC addresses are only meaningful within a local network.\nIP addresses enable global routing across different networks.\nIP provides a hierarchical addressing scheme for efficient routing.\nMAC addresses don’t scale for internet-wide communication.\nIP allows for logical network organization independent of hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow up question\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does ARP help bridge the gap between IP and MAC addresses?\n\nARP resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses for local network communication.\nIt enables devices to communicate using IP addresses while handling the underlying MAC addressing.\nARP is essential for routing packets between IP networks based on MAC addresses.\nARP maintains a mapping table (ARP cache) for efficient address resolution."
