## 2. What is parallel processing and load balancing in performance optimization?

**Parallel processing** is a method in computing of running two or more processors (CPUs) to handle separate parts of an overall task. 
- This is done to reduce the overall time taken to complete the task. But doing every task in parallel is not always efficient. Hence its up to the developer to decide which tasks can be done in parallel and which cannot.

**Load balancing** is the process of distributing the load among various pool computing resources, such as computers, a computer cluster, network links, central processing units, or disk drives. This is done so that the incomming load does not get queued up and all the resources are utilized efficiently.

## 3. How do users access cloud services? 

- Users can access cloud services through a **web browser** after logging into the cloud service provider's website. 
- They can also access cloud services through a **software application** that connects to the cloud service provider's API. 
This software application can be a mobile app, a desktop app, or a command-line interface.
- Users can also access cloud services **through a virtual private network (VPN)** connection to the cloud service provider's network.

These are some of the common ways in which users can access cloud services.

## 4. What is accessiblity and portability ?

**Accessibility** refers to the ability of users to access cloud services from anywhere in the world using any device with an internet connection. It ensures that users can access their data and applications whenever they need them.

**Portability** refers to the ability of users to move their data and applications between different cloud service providers. It ensures that users are not locked into a single cloud service provider and can switch providers if needed.

## 5. How do we achieve accessiblity and portability properties in cloud computing?

To acheive accessiblity and portability properties in cloud computing, we need to follow the below practices:

1. **Standardization**: Standardize the interfaces and protocols used by cloud service providers to ensure that users can access and move their data and applications between different providers.
2. **Interoperability**: Ensure that cloud service providers can work together to provide users with seamless access to their data and applications.
3. **Data portability**: Provide users with tools and services that allow them to easily move their data between different cloud service providers.
4. **Open standards**: Use open standards and open-source software to ensure that users are not locked into a single cloud service provider.
5. **APIs**: Provide users with APIs that allow them to access and manage their data and applications from any device or platform.
6. **Security**: Ensure that users' data and applications are secure and protected from unauthorized access or data breaches.
7. **Compliance**: Ensure that cloud service providers comply with industry standards and regulations to protect users' data and applications.

By following these practices, we can achieve accessiblity and portability properties in cloud computing.

## 6. What is SOA and SLA in cloud computing, explain them?

**SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)** is a software design approach that focuses on building software applications as a collection of loosely coupled services. These services are designed to be reusable, interoperable, and independent of the underlying technology.

- SOA allows organizations to build flexible and scalable software applications that can be easily integrated with other systems and services. 
- It also enables organizations to respond quickly to changing business requirements and market conditions.

### Components of SOA
- service implementation
- service contract
- service interface
- service provider 
- service consumer
- service registry

### Working of SOA

1. In SOA, services are designed to be self-contained and independent of other services.
2. Each service has a well-defined interface that specifies how it can be accessed and what it can do.
3. Services communicate with each other using standard protocols and data formats.
4. Services can be combined and orchestrated to create complex business processes.
5. Services can be reused across different applications and organizations.



**SLA (Service Level Agreement)** is a contract between a cloud service provider and a customer that defines the level of service that the provider will deliver. It specifies the performance metrics, availability, and support that the provider will provide to the customer.

- SLAs are used to ensure that cloud service providers meet the expectations of their customers and deliver the services that they have promised.
- SLAs also help to establish trust between the provider and the customer and provide a framework for resolving disputes and issues that may arise during the course of the service.

### Components of SLA
- Service scope
- Service availability
- Service performance
- Service support
- Service security

## 7. Explain about problems in traditional computing and how does Dynamic provisioning overcome these problems?

### Problems in traditional computing

1. **Underutilization of resources**: In traditional computing, resources are provisioned statically, which can lead to underutilization of resources. 
2. **Scalability issues**: Traditional computing environments are not easily scalable, there are lot of manual interventions required to scale up or down the resources.
3. **Limited flexibility**: Traditional computing environments are not very flexible and cannot easily adapt to changing business requirements.
4. **High costs**: Traditional computing environments are expensive to set up and maintain, as they require a lot of hardware and software resources.

### Dynamic provisioning

**Dynamic provisioning** is a cloud computing feature that allows users to automatically provision and deprovision resources based on demand. It enables users to scale their resources up or down as needed, without any manual intervention.

- Dynamic provisioning helps to overcome the problems of underutilization of resources, scalability issues, limited flexibility, and high costs that are associated with traditional computing environments.
- It allows users to optimize their resource usage, reduce costs, and improve the performance of their applications.

### How they overcome the problems?

1. By automatically provisioning and deprovisioning resources based on demand.
2. By enabling users to scale their resources up or down as needed.
3. By optimizing resource usage and reducing costs.
4. By improving the performance of applications.
5. By providing users with the flexibility to adapt to changing business requirements.
6. By reducing the manual intervention required to manage resources.

By using dynamic provisioning, users can overcome the problems associated with traditional computing environments and take advantage of the benefits of cloud computing.


## 8. Explain about QOS and SLA

**Quality of Service (QoS)** is all about prioritizing network traffic flows as per defined policies and rules.

- It allows classification and marking of different data streams.
- Higher priority traffic gets preferential treatment over lower priority flows during congestion.
- This ensures critical apps/services get the bandwidth and low latency they need.

**Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** are contractual commitments made by service providers.

- They specify measurable performance metrics like uptime, throughput, latency, etc.
- Clearly outline the expected quality of service the customer should receive.
- Failure to meet SLA terms may lead to penalties, credits or termination of contract.

In essence, QoS is the technical mechanism to optimize network performance, while SLAs are the commercial/legal guidelines that hold service providers accountable to deliver a guaranteed experience to users. A well-designed QoS policy complemented by a stringent SLA ensures your critical applications get the network love they deserve, you feel me?


## 9. What is Multi-Tenant Design in Cloud computing?

Multitenancy means that multiple customers of a cloud vendor are using the same computing resources. Despite the fact that they share resources, cloud customers are not aware of each other, and their data is kept totally separate.

The main advantage of multitenancy is 

- better usage of resources 
- lower costs for the cloud vendor, which can then be passed on to the customer.
- faster deployment of new features and updates.

## 10. Explain about Availability and Reliability and how to achieve them?

**Availability** is the measure of the time a system is up and running. It is usually expressed as a percentage of uptime over a given period of time. For example, a system with 99.9% availability is up and running 99.9% of the time.

**Reliability** is the measure of how well a system performs its intended functions. It is usually expressed as a percentage of successful operations over a given period of time. For example, a system with 99.9% reliability performs its intended functions 99.9% of the time.

To achieve availability and reliability in cloud computing, you can follow these best practices:

- **Redundancy**: Use redundant components to ensure that if one component fails, another component can take over.
- **Load balancing**: Distribute the load across multiple servers
- **Monitoring**: Monitor your system and take corrective actions when needed.
- **Backup and recovery**: Regularly backup your data and have a recovery plan in place.

By following these best practices, you can achieve availability and reliability in cloud computing.

## 11. What is fault Tolerance and its characteristics and why do we need it?

Fault tolerance refers to a system's ability to continue operating properly in the event of failures or faults with its components. It is a crucial characteristic for **mission-critical** systems and applications. (the bold part is keyword)

Characteristics of fault-tolerant systems:

- Redundancy: Having redundant components that can take over when others fail.
- Failover: Automatic switching to redundant components or systems when a failure occurs.
- Fault detection: Mechanisms to detect and isolate faults in real-time.
- Fault containment: Preventing faults from cascading and affecting the entire system.

We need fault tolerance because:

- It ensures high availability and reliability, minimizing downtime.
- It maintains data integrity and prevents data loss in case of failures.
- It provides business continuity and meets service level agreements (SLAs).
- It enhances system resilience, especially in mission-critical applications (e.g., healthcare, finance).

Fault tolerance is achieved through various techniques like redundant hardware, software failover mechanisms, error handling, and fault-tolerant system design principles like graceful degradation and self-healing capabilities.

## 12. What is the system secutiry and issues in it?

System security refers to the measures taken to protect computer systems and data from unauthorized access, cyberattacks, and other security threats. It encompasses various aspects of security, including:

- **Authentication**
- **Authorization**
- **Encryption**
- **Firewalls**

Common issues in system security are:

- **Data breaches**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Malware attacks**: Viruses, worms, ransomware, etc.
- **Phishing**: Social engineering attacks to steal sensitive information.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Overloading systems to disrupt services.
- **Insider threats**: Malicious actions by authorized users.
- **Weak passwords**: Vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

## 13. What are the traditional local computing power requirements and its problems, also explain how does cloud computing solve these problems?

Traditional local computing power requirements include:

- **High upfront costs**: Purchasing hardware, software, and infrastructure.
- **Limited scalability**: Difficulty in scaling resources up or down.
- **Maintenance and management**: Regular updates, patches, and backups.
- **Security risks**: Vulnerabilities and data breaches.

The cloud architecture solves all of these problems because the same amout of resources are being used by multiple users. As multiple users use the same resources, the cost is shared among them. This reduces the cost for each user. 

Also, the cloud provider takes care of the maintenance and management of the resources, which reduces the burden on the user. The cloud provider also takes care of the secure issues apart from that having many number of users will make the cloud provider or the system user to identify and report the detected security issues and provid a fix ot them faster.

## 14. To achieve what we need System control automation and system state monitoring? And explain about both of them

To acheive **falut tolerance**, **high availability**  and **reliability** we need system control automation and system state monitoring.

**System Control Automation:**

- Automating system control tasks like resource provisioning, configuration management, and scaling.
- It enables self-healing and self-recovery mechanisms to mitagate and recover form faults automatically (generally some script)
- It reduces manual intervention, human errors, and response time to incidents.

**System State Monitoring:**

- Cntinious monitoring and tracking of system components, performance metrics, and health status.
- It helps in detecting anomalies, predicting failures, and taking proactive actions.
- It detects these anaomalies / issues by checking the data from the system and comparing it with the expected data.

By combining system control automation and system state monitoring, organizations can ensure that their systems are resilient, responsive, and reliable in dynamic cloud environments.

## 15. What are the advantages and disadvantages of cloud computing?

## 16. Explain about IaaS

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** is a cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It allows users to rent virtual servers, storage, and networking infrastructure on a pay-as-you-go basis.

- Users can deploy and manage their applications on the cloud infrastructure without having to worry about the underlying hardware. 
- IaaS providers take care of the maintenance, security, and scalability of the infrastructure

**example:** a person can rent a virtual server from a cloud provider and deploy their application on it.

## 17. Explain about PaaS

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)** is a cloud computing model that provides a platform for developing, testing, and deploying applications over the internet. It allows users to build and run applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.

- PaaS providers offer a complete development environment, including tools, libraries, and frameworks, to help users build and deploy applications quickly.
- Users can focus on developing their applications, while the PaaS provider takes care of the infrastructure, security, and scalability.

**example:** a person can use a PaaS provider to build and deploy a web application without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure like servers, storage, and networking.


## 18. Explain about SaaS

**Software as a Service (SaaS)** is a cloud computing model that provides software applications over the internet. It allows users to access and use software applications without having to install or maintain them on their local devices.

- SaaS providers host and manage the software applications on their servers and deliver them to users over the internet.
- Users can access the software applications through a web browser or a software client, and pay for them on a subscription basis.

**example:** a person can use a SaaS provider to access and use a customer relationship management (CRM) software application over the internet. which in simple terms means that the user can use the software without installing it on their local machine.

## 19. How to deploy a cloud system?

To deploy a cloud system, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Define requirements**: Identify the business needs, technical requirements, and goals of the cloud system.
2. **Select a cloud model**: Choose between IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS based on your requirements.
3. **Select a cloud provider**: Choose a cloud service provider that meets your needs and budget.

| Aspect | Edge Computing | Fog Computing |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Location** | Close to data source or device | Between data source and cloud |
| **Latency** | Low latency for real-time processing | Lower latency than cloud, higher than edge |
| **Scalability** | Limited scalability due to proximity | Scalable for distributed processing |
| **Resource Constraints** | Limited resources, constrained environment | More resources, less constrained environment |
| **Data Processing** | Real-time processing at the edge | Processing closer to data source |

### **Edge Computing**

Edge computing is a paradigm that involves processing data at or near the source, rather than transmitting it to a centralized cloud or data center for processing. In edge computing, computational resources (such as processors, storage, and networking capabilities) are placed at the edge of the network, closer to the devices or sensors generating the data.

### **Fog Computing**

Fog computing is an extension of the edge computing paradigm, where a higher level of computation and storage resources is distributed across the network, creating a "fog" between the edge devices and the cloud. Fog computing involves a hierarchical architecture, with fog nodes placed at various points along the network path, providing intermediate processing and storage capabilities.

:::{.callout-note}
Edge computing focuses on processing data at the extreme edge of the network, while fog computing introduces an intermediate layer with more powerful computing resources between the edge and the cloud.
